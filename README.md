This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Install Angular CLI

Install Angular globally on your machine with this snippet.
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Coding Angular with Typescript

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the Angular extension is recommended due to good code suggestion and real-time lint for the **Typescript** and Angular syntaxes.

## Creating a Playground

To play around with some Angular on the side before getting into this repository's project files, it would be helpful to check out [Using Angular in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/angular-tutorial). Be sure to use Typescript (not Javascript) and CSS (not SASS, SCSS, or )

## Run the Development Server

To run, `cd` to the repository root folder and run `ng serve` for a local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change and save any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

> NOTE: Creating a component with the command `ng g component chatWindow` will create a component `chat-window-component`. In other words, no need to add the type of the newly scaffolded code to the name of it, Angular CLI will add it for you. Newly scaffolded files are placed in the following folder: 
> 
> ./src/app/GETS_PLACED_HERE

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
