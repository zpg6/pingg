This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Install Angular CLI

Install Angular globally on your machine with this snippet.
`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## Development server

To run, `cd` to the repository root folder and run `ng serve` for a local dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change and save any of the source files. VSCode with the Angular extension is recommended due to good code suggestion and real-time lint for the Typescript and Angular syntaxes.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
